Trolley is, so to speak, a calculator especially for shopping. 
You have a list in which you can see what you are currently purchasing. You can enter the items by hand or using a barcode scanner. Unfortunately, there is no central contact point where you can ask for the price.
You only get the item name.

The app is written with NodeJS, Ionic and Angular and there is still a lot of work to be done.
